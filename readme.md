## About Abacus Market
Abacus Market was established in mid-2021 under the name 'Alphabet Market'. However, this was soon changed to avoid any confusion with the re-launched AlphaBay Market. The market has grown to a considerable size and currently features over 45,000 listings.

### Registration / Login process:

Abacus Market kindly requests that you set both a public and private username. The private username will only be known by you and be used for logging in. The public username will be visible to vendors or market support staff. This helps to ensure that nobody will be able to target your account since they won't know your private username. You'll also need to provide a password, PIN code and login phrase (an anti-phishing measure). We believe that our security features for users of Abacus Market will help to minimise the risk of your account becoming compromised, so you can rest easy.
